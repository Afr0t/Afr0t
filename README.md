## A passionate of IT and Dev since my young age :blush:

As a teenager at school, I was the kid other students approached about issues with their phone or laptop. I was the go-to guy for fixing any technical problems.

Today, not much has changed. Iâ€™m still the first point of call for technical issues. The difference is I now also develop innovative web apps and softwares to solve the problems of multinational companies. One of my most recent projects involved designing and rolling-out a new piece of software to optimise the efficiency of artist booking, from my experience from the Udacity fuyyr project.

Although Iâ€™m still following the Udacity fullstack web development nanodegree, I am well on my way to being a multilingual programmer.
